First, we change getDefaultConfig() at config-helper.js by adding the following snippet:

exploit: {
        username: 'root',
        password: 12p@ss*word34,
        database: 'database_exploit',
        host: '127.0.0.1',
        dialect: 'mysql'
      }

And by running the unit test: test/url.test.js, we can see that the password is not filtered correctly (it's logged in plain text) and the unit test fails.
