/src/README.md:164:This plugin adds the integrity attribute to `<link rel="preload">`
/src/README.md:165:tags, but preloading with SRI doesn't work as expected in current
/src/README.md-166-Chrome versions.  The resource will be loaded twice, defeating the
/src/README.md:167:purpose of preloading.  This problem doesn't appear to exist in
/src/README.md-168-Firefox or Safari.  See [issue
